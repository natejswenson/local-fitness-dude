"""Garmin Connect credential storage via macOS Keychain (keyring lib).

We store the email under a fixed key so we know what account is wired up,
then password under that email. garminconnect / garth handles the actual
session-token caching to disk so MFA is only required on first login.

Container deployments can't read the host's macOS Keychain, so
get_credentials() falls back to GARMIN_EMAIL + GARMIN_PASSWORD env vars
when both are set. Host CLI keeps Keychain primacy.
