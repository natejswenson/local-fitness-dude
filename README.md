# local-fitness

Local Garmin-data agent. Three-year history sits in a SQLite DB, a daily
launchd job pulls overnight, and a Claude-powered agent writes you a morning
briefing — or chats about your training when you ask.

Built around a Garmin Instinct Solar (no overnight HRV Status — uses Body
Battery, RHR, sleep, stress, and per-workout Training Effect / training load).

## What it does

- **One-time historical backfill** from Garmin Connect's "Request your data" ZIP.
- **Daily auto-pull** via the unofficial `garminconnect` library (catches up if
  the laptop was closed for days).
- **Pre-computed baselines:** 60-day rolling mean/SD for RHR, sleep, body
  battery, stress, plus the Banister CTL/ATL/TSB training-load model.
- **Local Claude agent** (Sonnet 4.6 default, Opus 4.7 on demand) with 11 tools
  for querying the DB. Writes a daily morning briefing and supports an
  interactive REPL.
- Auth via your existing Claude Code subscription — no API key needed.

## Setup

```bash
# 1. Make sure Claude Code is logged in with your subscription
claude  # then /login if not already authenticated

# 2. Install deps and the `fitness` command
uv sync

# 3. Store Garmin creds in macOS Keychain + init DB
uv run fitness setup

# 4. Pull live data (catches up since last successful run)
uv run fitness pull

# 5. Optional: backfill 3 years of history once your Garmin export ZIP arrives
#    (Garmin Connect → Account → Account Information → Export Your Data;
#     they email a ZIP within a few days)
uv run fitness backfill ~/Downloads/garmin-export.zip

# 6. Recompute baselines + training load
uv run fitness recompute-baselines

# 7. Generate today's briefing on demand
uv run fitness brief

# 8. Install the daily launchd job (runs `fitness brief` at 6:30 AM,
#    catches up on next wake if the Mac was asleep)
./ops/install-launchd.sh

# 9. Build + serve the web UI (one-time build; `fitness serve` reads the dist/)
cd web && pnpm install && pnpm build && cd ..
uv run fitness serve --open  # opens http://127.0.0.1:8765 in your browser
```

## Usage

```bash
fitness pull                  # pull since last success
fitness brief                 # pull + recompute + briefing → briefings/YYYY-MM-DD.md
fitness brief --opus          # use Opus 4.7
fitness chat                  # interactive REPL
fitness serve                 # web UI at http://127.0.0.1:8765
fitness ask "should I run hard today?"
fitness ask "compare last 30 days vs prior 30 days for RHR" --opus
fitness status                # DB row counts and last ingest run info
```

## Web UI

`fitness serve` starts a localhost-only FastAPI server (default port 8765)
that exposes the DB + agent over REST and NDJSON-streamed chat, plus serves
the built React frontend.

Three views:
- **Chat** (default) — streaming conversation with the agent. Tool calls
  shown as inline pills so you see what data it's pulling. Sonnet/Opus toggle.
- **Today** — auto-generated morning brief at top, then stat cards for body
  battery, RHR, sleep, and form (TSB) with sparklines and 60-day baseline
  deltas. Recent workouts table at bottom.
- **Trends** — interactive Banister CTL/ATL/TSB area chart plus a metric
  picker (RHR, sleep, body battery, stress, VO₂ max) with 60-day baseline
  overlay where applicable. Date-range toggle (30d → all).

Dev mode: `cd web && pnpm dev` runs Vite at :5173 with API proxied to
`fitness serve` at :8765.

## Database

SQLite at `~/localrepo/local-fitness/data/fitness.db`.

Tables: `daily_metrics`, `body_battery_samples`, `stress_samples`,
`activities`, `activity_hr_zones`, `activity_splits`, `baselines`,
`ingest_runs`. Raw Garmin JSON is preserved on every wellness/activity row so
new fields can be derived later without re-pulling.

## Honest caveats

- `garminconnect` is reverse-engineered. Garmin changes their site occasionally
  and the library breaks for a few days until the community patches it. When
  that happens, `fitness pull` logs an auth error and the next day's briefing
  flags it.
- Subscription auth shares the same Claude Code rate-limit pool. One daily
  briefing is rounding error; heavy `fitness chat` sessions can compete with
  your Claude Code usage.
- Instinct Solar lacks overnight HRV Status (a 2022-and-newer Garmin feature),
  so recovery analysis leans on Body Battery + RHR + sleep + training load
  rather than HRV.
